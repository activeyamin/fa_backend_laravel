                                                  Accounting is a critical component of businesses and organisations, with accountants working to ensure financial records are meticulously kept and that the correct taxes are paid. Accountants provide an overview of how a business is tracking financially, which then informs the company’s annual reports, legal filings and future endeavours.

                                                  In most Accounting courses, you can expect to go over accounting theory, business administration schemes and even some business law. You’ll learn how to prepare documents like financial statements, tax returns and business proposals as well as gain an understanding of finance, quantitative analytics and maths. This means an Accounting course can actually open up a variety of career pathways in finance, banking, business and beyond.

A two-year course can be a great way of saving money, but just make sure to research the job prospects that people with shorter degrees have in your area. If the market is competitive, a minimum of a Bachelor’s degree may be necessary.
