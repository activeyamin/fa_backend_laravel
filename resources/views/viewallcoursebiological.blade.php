                                                  To thrive in Computing & IT, you’ll need a technical mindset. This means an ability to understand technical information, multitask and pay attention to details is crucial. While many people think Computing & IT roles are solitary endeavours, you’ll actually need to be a good communicator and team player, as technical issues will need to be tackled from various angles using an entire team’s skills. Computing & IT is particularly well-suited to those who are passionate about learning and want to create change in a rapidly evolving world. Due to how diverse the field is, you’ll also be able to zone into a specialisation. This can include computer science, information systems, software development, AI, and so much more.

                                                  Computing & IT is a flexible and diverse pathway, meaning there’s a variety of study options to consider. Most professionals have a three or four-year Bachelor’s degree, which can cost between £9,000-30,000 a year in the UK, around AUD$30,000 a year in Australia, and between USD$20,000-40,000 a year in the US.
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="view_all_course_flage_pera_pos my-4">
                                                  However, it’s also important to know that some roles within the Computing & IT industry don’t necessarily require a degree. Often a certificate or diploma is enough. For example, less than half of IT support workers actually have a Bachelor’s degree! At the same time, higher levels of education can translate to higher salaries - those with a doctoral degree in computer science earn an average of USD$93,050 in the US while those with Bachelor’s degrees only earn USD$50,820.
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="view_all_course_flage_pera_pos">
                                                  Finally, remember that even after obtaining a qualification, you might require certifications or security clearances for certain roles. This could be an Amazon Web Services certification, an industry accreditation like CISA or CISSP, or a Google certification, depending on the kinds of roles you’re aiming for.
