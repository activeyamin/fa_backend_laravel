                                                  Architects possess certain skills and among them, analytical aptitude is topmost. Secondly, they are effective communicators, as their profession demands collaborating with other professionals to work on a project. Thirdly, a creative eye is essential to the trade. It enables architects to scrutinise the overall aesthetic of a structure at a glance. And last but not the least, they must have technical proficiency in software needed for architecture and design. If you think you have the aptitude to become proficient in all these skills, then a fruitful career awaits you in the field of building and architecture.
